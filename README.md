This was started as a 
["Build Your Own Shell" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/shell/overview) on [codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io).

Description: In this challenge, you'll build your own POSIX compliant shell that's capable of
interpreting shell commands, running external programs and builtin commands like
cd, pwd, echo and more. Along the way, you'll learn about shell command parsing,
REPLs, builtin commands, and more.
